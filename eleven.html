        You can see… Karma
        
        You can see patterns unfolding
        
        (of which this life is only a part, part of a mosaic)
        
        But: in order to do that 
        You have to have left 
        The gravitational field 
        Of
        Time and space
        
        You can't think in… time & space
        
        You can't be in… your thoughts
        Any more!
        
        Because your thoughts are still in time
        & space & you can't get out of time 
        Through them. 
        
        You've got to be outside
        That. 
        
        you've got to be in the place where
        You see your own
        
        And: not only that one but that one & …
        That one & that too…
